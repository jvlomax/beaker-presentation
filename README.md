# How to build a Skype bot using python and Skype4Py
This is a tutorial created for the Python north west user group.
It shows how to create a bot for skype from scratch using the Skype4Py library.


## Requirements
* Python2.7
* Skype4Py

## Usage
The folders stage 1-5 show the progression when createing the bot. The first 3 stages cover the basics.
Staged 4-5 show more advanced topics, such as plugins and dynamic loading of modules to allow plugins to be created at runtime.

#### Warning
Most of this code was written while discovering my fondness for scotch whisky. This may be reflected in the quality of the code.

This project also contains code that is very unsafe. Loading unkown python modules at runtime is a bad idea, don't do it!

**You have been warned!**
